# ChangeLog for <clip-layout>/<rm-devices>

*rm-devices-1.1.2 (01 Feb 2011)

  01 Feb 2011; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.1.2.ebuild, -rm-devices-1.1.1.ebuild:
  Create /dev/pts trees for jail_devs and update_devs (needed
  for vsctl enter to work, respectively in rm_* jails and 
  secure_update_rm_* jails), when PID namespaces are used.

*rm-devices-1.1.1 (18 Jan 2011)

  18 Jan 2011; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.1.1.ebuild, -rm-devices-1.1.0.ebuild:
  Make ptmx a symlink to pts/ptmx for use with multiple instances
  of devpts.

*rm-devices-1.1.0 (10 Mar 2009)

  10 Mar 2009; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.1.0.ebuild, -rm-devices-1.0-r6.ebuild:
  Remove ADMIN devices.

*rm-devices-1.0-r6 (13 Mar 2008)

  13 Mar 2008; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.0-r6.ebuild, -rm-devices-1.0-r5.ebuild:
  Make /dev/log point to /log rather than /var/run/log, to make
  sure the log socket is protected against deletion from the inside
  of the view.

  07 Nov 2007; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  Remove all ebuilds before 1.0-r5.

*rm-devices-1.0-r5 (26 Sep 2007)

  26 Sep 2007; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.0-r5.ebuild:
  Remove clip-lsm from IUSE.

*rm-devices-1.0-r4 (16 Jul 2007)

  16 Jul 2007; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.0-r4.ebuild:
  Make the jail_devs' /dev/log point to ../update/var/run/log, 
  since syslog does not open a socket outside the views.

*rm-devices-1.0-r3 (25 Jun 2007)

  25 Jun 2007; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.0-r3.ebuild:
  Create basic devices for the audit view.
  Create /dev/log symlink for every view.
  Remove /dev/veriexec from the jail root, it is no longer 
  needed.
  Remove random from basic device set, it is not really needed 
  and might expose use to a ressource exhaustion attack. Replace
  it with a symlink to /dev/urandom for those few applications 
  using it (e.g. gpg). That will have to be entropy enough for 
  RM_X.

*rm-devices-1.0-r2 (26 Apr 2007)

  26 Apr 2007; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.0-r2.ebuild:
  Add /dev/mapper directory in jail_devs.
  
*rm-devices-1.0-r1 (30 Jan 2007)

  30 Jan 2007; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.0-r1.ebuild:
  Add clip-lsm to IUSE. If set, create the veriexec device in jail_devs
  and update_devs.
  
*rm-devices-1.0 (27 Jul 2006)

  27 Jul 2006; Vincent Strubel <clipos@ssi.gouv.fr>
  +rm-devices-1.0.ebuild:
  Initial version. Creates those devices needed by the update, user
  and admin view in a given jail compartment, as well as those needed
  by the jail core. 
  To be emerged with a proper CLIP_VROOTS env var. We need to do that 
  from a core package, since installing device nodes requires CAP_MKNOD.
